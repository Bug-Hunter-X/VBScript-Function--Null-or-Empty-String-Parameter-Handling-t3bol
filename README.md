This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript functions: the failure to properly handle null or empty string parameters. The `bug.vbs` file shows the function with the error, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version.  The issue is that string concatenation with null or empty parameters can lead to unexpected results or runtime errors. The solution involves adding explicit checks for these cases.
